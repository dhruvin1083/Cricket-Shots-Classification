How to run the code

1. Copy the folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UzvybenTRZ8inpVgouJdLaxtCOnhvvbU?usp=sharing) to your drive.
2. Mount the drive and change the 'path_img' variable in the second code cell according to the location of the copied folder in your drive.
3. Run the code cells one by one and it will give the required outputs.

NOTE: We have commented the dataset reading part because it is time consuming and we have saved the dataset as numpy array already in the folder.
