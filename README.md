# Cricket-Shots-Classification
Cricket Shot Classification using CNN-SoftMax and CNN-SVM Classifiers
We have developed a SoftMax based convolutional neural network and a SVM based convolutional neural network for classification of cricket shots.
Later, we have comapred the performance of both models using different metrics. 
This was a mini project done under the guidance of Dr. Ranjana Vyas(Assistant Professor, IIIT-A).
