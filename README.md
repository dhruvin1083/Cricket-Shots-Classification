# Cricket-Shots-Classification 
We have developed a SoftMax based convolutional neural network and a SVM based convolutional neural network for classification of cricket shots.
Later, we have comapred the performance of both models using different metrics. There was an existing shotnet model whose accuracy was below 80%. We have upgraded that existing model with completely different techniques, which gives us an accuracy of 92.2%(more than 90% on an average). 

# This was a mini project done under the guidance of Dr. Ranjana Vyas(Assistant Professor, IIIT-A).
